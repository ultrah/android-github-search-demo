# GitHub Search - An Android Architecture Playground Project

A small app that combines Android Architecture Components with RxJava to create an MVVM architecture that is easy to use and understand. The user can search for repositories and the first 30 results are displayed together with a very simple score that indicates how popular the repository is.

## Core Concepts:

- LiveData + ViewModel for the Android lifecycle
- RXJava for model related things
- Dependency Injection by hand, which makes the concept easier to understand. Use a library if you need an actual graph, scopes, etc.

Things to do: Paging, proper Espresso tests, caching and more.
